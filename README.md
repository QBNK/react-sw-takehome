# QBank React Take-home Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to show your proficiency in the following areas:

- Basic CSS knowledge
- Typescript
- React built-in state management
- Working with REST API's
- Component composition

## Starting out

Start by forking the repository and cloning it onto your machine. Then:

- Open the project directory
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

And off you go! (Assuming you have [NodeJS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en) installed)

## Features

The features to build are the following:

- Display a list of Star Wars characters using the [Star Wars Public API](https://swapi.dev/) through their `/people` endpoint
- Results should be paginated
- Each item in the results should be presented as a card that contain a random image from a service like [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/), the name of the character, as well as some kind of color coding based on the character species
- Display a loading indicator when data are being fetched

### If you have the time

Absolutely no need, but if you find that you have the time for it:

- Implement a detail view modal which displays more details about a character. The modal can for example be opened by clicking one of the list items.
- Explore the API to see if you can find more relevant information to show in the detail view.

## Implementation

In this one, we keep it simple! What we want you to use are:

- Regular CSS or other Vite-supported CSS tools
- Typescript. At least define types for component props.
- React Context for storing and using fetched API data
- React `useState` for storing component state
- `fetch` for fetching API data

## Focus-areas

Keep the tooling simple. We want to see that you know the basics. We will assess the following:

- Look and feel of the UI
- Code structure, style, readability, performance and composition of components
- Type safety

## Submitting the code

Simply reach out to your recruitment contact and provide a link to your forked code-base.
